The MyEssentials plugin is a beginner plugin I'm creating for my Minecraft server.
I've taken inspiration from other plugins that I've seen throughout the year, and want to try and recreate them for my server!

So far, I have added (as of 1/10/24):

1. Coords on Player Death functionality: if a player dies, the server sends that player the coordinates of their death location.
- One of the big reasons I wanted to create this was so my less-experienced friends didn't have to keep dying and losing their items.
- Sure, dying and losing your items are part of the game, but it sure is annoying when you continuously die and have no idea where your stuff is

2. New Player Joins functionality: is a new player joins, it sends a message to them explaining the new things added to the server.
- Is this important? Absolutely not. However, it was interesting to finally figure out how some basic Java functions worked (Especially PrintWriter, that darned thing).

I hope to slowly continue to update this in order to not only practice my Java skills, but also to give myself some challenges and keep my creativity alive!
